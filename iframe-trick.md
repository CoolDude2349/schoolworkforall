If you can't access the offline pages and it's blocked, you can load it instead in an iframe, while offline. 

Here is what to do:

1. Go to your iframe viewer. 
2. Once your in the page of the iframe, switch offline.
3. The iframe should say offline.
4. Turn your wifi back on.
5. Wait till you have wifi and immediately try to run the iframe.
6. Once the iframe shows the content, click the button super fast.

Now you can view the page you want offline using an iframe, or just visit the page directly while offline. You won't need to do steps 4 and 5.
