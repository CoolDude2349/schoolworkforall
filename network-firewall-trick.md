Here are three options that I've made for getting around this:

1. Open your preferred page at home and load up to about:blank. Use that window to keep the about:blank page open so it doesnt refresh. Then open another window for your school stuff. Now, when you're at school, open the other window and load your content.
2. Use a v p%n. There are many avaliable on the chrome web store, but you can also add one in settings I believe.
3. Use the code editor scripts that are avaliable in this repo.
