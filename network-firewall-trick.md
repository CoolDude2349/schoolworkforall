Here are three options that I've made for getting around this:

1. Open your preferred page at home and load up to about:blank. Use a new window to keep the about:blank page open so it doesnt refresh. Now, when you're at schools, open the window and load your content.
2. Use a v p%n. There are many avaliable on the chrome web store, but you can also add one in settings I belive.
3. Use the code editor scripts that are avaliable in this repo.
